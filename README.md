Precipitation Estimation and Analysis of Rainfall Factors in Bengaluru Using Machine Learning

A project that leverages scikit-learn libraries to develop a machine learning model for predicting rainfall. 
The project incorporates data analysis and visualization using the tkinter library for creating a user-friendly interface. 
It enables users to input weather parameters and obtain rainfall predictions based on historical data from Bengaluru weather stations.
